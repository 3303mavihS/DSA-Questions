# üìö DSA Questions Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** Questions repository!  
This space is dedicated to documenting my journey of solving DSA problems ‚Äî covering everything from problem statements and code to deep-dive explanations and complexity analysis.

## üß† What's Inside?

Each problem is stored in a dedicated `.md` (Markdown) file and follows a consistent structure:

### ‚úçÔ∏è Format for Each Question

- **Problem Description**  
  A clear explanation of the problem statement.

- **Understanding**  
  Initial observations, constraints, and what the problem is really asking for.

- **Approach & Explanation**  
  Step-by-step breakdown of how the problem is approached, any algorithms used, and key reasoning behind the logic.

- **Code**  
  Well-commented solution (usually in C++ or preferred language).

- **Time & Space Complexity**  
  A concise breakdown of the computational complexity.

- **Edge Cases / Learnings**  
  Any tricky cases encountered or concepts reinforced.
